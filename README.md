## What I need?
First of all you need the following technologies:
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
* [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or `npm install -g pnpm`
* [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) (Optional) or `npm install -g typescript`

## Why pnpm?
A little tip for you, reader, is that `pnpm` works like `npm` but it has a global storage, so, it make a shortcut of the cached dependencies to our projects and save a lot of space and time installing.

## What to do now?
Inside this project you have 2 spaces. One for the client and other for the server.

You must to do the following instructions:

1. Go to server directory and install the dependencies
```bash
cd server
pnpm install 
```
2. Run the server
```bash
npm run dev # You can access to it at localhost:3000
```
3. Open a new console and go to the client directory and install the dependencies
```bash
cd client
pnpm install
```
4. Run te server
```
npm run dev
```

5. Enjoy!
